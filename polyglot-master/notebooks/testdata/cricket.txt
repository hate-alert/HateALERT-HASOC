Australia posted a World Cup record total of 417-6 as they beat Afghanistan by 275 runs.
David Warner hit 178 off 133 balls, Steve Smith scored 95 while Glenn Maxwell struck 88 in 39 deliveries in the Pool A encounter in Perth.
Afghanistan were then dismissed for 142, with Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc taking six wickets between them.
Australia's score surpassed the 413-5 India made against Bermuda in 2007.
It continues the pattern of bat dominating ball in this tournament as the third 400 plus score achieved in the pool stages, following South Africa's 408-5 and 411-4 against West Indies and Ireland respectively.
The winning margin beats the 257-run amount by which India beat Bermuda in Port of Spain in 2007, which was equalled five days ago by South Africa in their victory over West Indies in Sydney.
